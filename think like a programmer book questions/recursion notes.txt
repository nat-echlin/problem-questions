*** Recursion occurs when you have a function that calls itself ***

There are two types: head recursion and tail recursion ;
Head is where the function call occurs before the processing, and tail is where the function
    call occurs after the processing in the function.

Big Recursive Idea (BRI) :
    When you pass along a smaller version of a problem for someone else to solve, you don't care
    how it's done, just that it is. 


Start by identifying a 'base case' which is when the function will return the correct result,
    without having to call itself again. From there build it up.
